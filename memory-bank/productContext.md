# Product Context

## Why This Exists
DJs and producers need quick, intuitive filter controls during live performances and production. Traditional plugins require switching between different filter types or using multiple knobs. This plugin provides the familiar single-knob workflow found on professional DJ mixers.

## Problem It Solves
- **Complexity:** Most filter plugins have too many controls for live performance
- **Workflow:** Switching between LPF and HPF breaks creative flow
- **Familiarity:** DJs expect the Pioneer mixer filter behavior

## How It Should Work
The user experience should be immediate and intuitive:

1. **Turn Left:** Sound becomes warmer, darker (low-pass)
2. **Turn Right:** Sound becomes brighter, thinner (high-pass)
3. **Center:** Clean, unaffected sound
4. **Smooth Transition:** No clicks or pops when moving the knob

## User Experience Goals
- **Instant Understanding:** Anyone familiar with DJ mixers knows how to use it
- **Performance Ready:** Fast, responsive, no latency
- **Visual Clarity:** Clear indication of current filter state
- **Professional Quality:** Sounds as good as hardware filters

## Target Users
- DJs (live performance)
- Electronic music producers
- Sound designers
- Anyone needing quick filter effects
